Before main.py can be run you must load the pretrained embeddings with load_embeddings.sh script.

I'm not sure if the test data uses underscores or hyphens for the relation labels. I went with underscores because that's what the training data uses.

There's a chance you need to run this:    conda install -c intel mkl_fft
Pip wasn't able to install it so I removed it from the requirements.txt
